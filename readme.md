-

##Description##

An attemp at building a HAR viewer that mimics [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/overview)


###Missing Features
 - Timing Detail View
 - TimeLine Sorting (Start Time, Response Time, End Time, Duration, Latency)
 - Page Speed API (Need to check if pagespeed allows this but it'll be nice.)
 - User Settings (I'm not quiet sure what to put in there yet)
 - Bottom Info - (# of Request, Transfer size, etc..)
 - Offline Support

###Known Bugs
 - Probably a lot.
